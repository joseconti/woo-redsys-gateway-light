# Phase 7 — Release

Goal: get the project to a clean, shippable state — nothing secret or unnecessary in git, nothing dev-only in the distributable package, a versioned and documented release.

## Two distinct hygiene boundaries

These are different and both matter:

1. **What never enters git** → `.gitignore`. Secrets, env files, build output, dependencies, OS/editor cruft. If it should not be in history at all, it goes here.
2. **What is in git but must NOT reach the final distributed package** → `.gitattributes` with `export-ignore`. Tests, dev tooling, CI config, the `docs/` source, design handoff, build scripts — useful in the repo, but the user's distributable (e.g. the plugin ZIP produced by `git archive`) must be lean.

Confusing these is a common defect: a dev file ends up shipped, or a needed runtime file is excluded. Decide each path's boundary explicitly.

## Steps

### 1. `.gitignore`

**Who performs the release (read before anything else in this phase).** Keel prepares it — the candidate on `develop`, the full gate, the version proposal, the notes, the artifacts — and stops. **The merge to `main`/`master`, the tag and the published release are the user's acts**, performed only on an explicit instruction in the current conversation (SKILL.md, "Git flow"; the version number itself follows the same propose-and-wait rule). Keel says the candidate is ready and what remains to be pressed; it never presses it.

Generate per project type. Always exclude: secrets/credentials, `.env*`, local config with tokens, dependency dirs (`vendor/`, `node_modules/`), build artifacts, logs, OS files (`.DS_Store`), editor dirs (`.idea/`, `.vscode/` unless intentionally shared), personal assistant config (`CLAUDE.local.md`, `.claude/settings.local.json`), the update-check throttle stamp (`.keel-update-check`), and the ephemeral session hand-off (`docs/continuation-prompt.md`, per `references/project-state.md`). Add type-specific entries:
- WordPress plugin: build dirs, `vendor/` if committing only built deps, local WP test env.
- MCP server / web app (e.g. Fly.io): `.env`, deploy secrets, local data volumes.
- Library/component: build output, coverage, packaging artifacts.

Verify nothing sensitive is already tracked, running the full confidential-data check (SKILL.md "Confidential data never reaches Git") over the WHOLE tracked tree — not only the files changed lately. If something is tracked: flag it to the user explicitly — it must be removed from history (`git filter-repo` / BFG), not just ignored, and any credential that was ever pushed is compromised and must be rotated.

### 2. `.gitattributes` with `export-ignore`

Mark everything that belongs in the repo but not in the shipped package as `export-ignore`, so `git archive` produces a clean distributable. Typically: `/tests`, `/.github`, CI config, `/docs` (source docs — ship a built/user-facing subset if relevant), `/design` handoff, build/dev scripts, linter/formatter configs, `.gitattributes`/`.gitignore` themselves, example/fixture data, and the Keel workflow files (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md` when kept, `/.claude/` and `/.agents/` including the embedded skill, every generated assistant config tree — `/.codex/`, `/.cursor/`, `/.gemini/`, `/.windsurf/`, `/.github/instructions/`, `/.github/agents/`, `/.vscode/mcp.json`, nested context files — `/.githooks`, `/.mcp.json`) — they govern development, never the distributable.

Keep in the package: runtime code, runtime assets, the readme/license the end user needs, the user-facing docs you intend to ship.

State the resulting package contents to the user so the boundary is visible and agreed.

### 3. Versioning & changelog

- **Propose the version; never decide it.** The Keel version discipline applies at project scale: the assistant PROPOSES the number — patch / minor / major per the project's scheme, with one line of reasoning — and WAITS for the user's explicit approval before writing any version number anywhere. Only after that approval does it sync the touchpoints below. A version decided unilaterally is a defect, whatever the number.
- **Sync every version touchpoint.** `docs/03-technical-plan.md` lists every place the version string lives (e.g. plugin main-file header, readme.txt `Stable tag`, a VERSION constant, package.json). Update ALL of them to the same value and verify they match — a mismatched touchpoint (header says 2.1.1, stable tag says 2.1.0) is a classic release defect that breaks updates.
- Update the changelog: **oldest → newest ordering** (e.g. 2.1.0 then 2.1.1). Never invert.
- Each entry: what changed, grouped (added/changed/fixed/security), referencing features from `docs/`.

### 4. Pre-release verification

Before tagging:
- **Executed checks, not log reading.** "Phase 5 test points all pass" is verified by RE-RUNNING now, on the release candidate — never by reading `docs/05-test-points.md`: run the ENTIRE automated suite against the exact distributable being tagged and record command + result in `docs/07-release.md`; run `scripts/keel-verify` on the candidate — clean, output recorded. Phase 6 docs complete.
- **`scripts/keel-doctor --check` passes on this machine, and the drivers still drive.** The whole pre-release suite is worthless if it silently degraded to "the environment could not run it" — so the doctor runs first and its table goes into `docs/07-release.md`. Any **blocking** requirement that is `MISSING` or `NOT OPERATIONAL` means the checks below have not really run (an optional row missing is noted, not a blocker): fix the environment, or record honestly which checks could not execute and why. A green report produced by tests that never started is the worst possible release artifact.
- **The conformance sweep is current** (SKILL.md "Applying Keel completely"): `docs/keel-conformance.md` regenerated against `MANIFEST.md` at this project's position, every row `present`, `declined` with its decision entry, or `n/a` with its condition. Nothing `missing` without a decision. If Keel was updated during this cycle, the Table 3 delta for every version newer than the project's baseline has been applied or explicitly declined — not partially, and not from recollection.
- **Every user-visible acceptance criterion was verified by a driven test on the candidate**, and every remaining delegation carries one of the eight tags (`references/test-automation.md`) with its steps and its result. A criterion whose only evidence is "the user said it worked" is acceptable ONLY where it carries one of those tags; anywhere else it is an untested criterion wearing a verdict (`references/test-automation.md`).
- **Walk `docs/PROGRESS.md`'s open items.** Every `⚠ unverified` step or asset is re-attempted in the real environment NOW, or the user accepts it explicitly with a `docs/decisions.md` entry. Nothing unverified rides silently into the tag.
- **Zero placeholder copy in the distributable** (`scripts/keel-verify` checks the surfaces mechanically; confirm on the built package).
- **The end-user guide honors its recorded decision** (card `User guide:`): if it ships, it is present in the package, its index navigates, its coverage matches the release's capabilities (a feature shipped without its guide section is a gap), and it is placeholder-clean; if it does not ship, `/guide/` is export-ignored and absent from the package.
- **Performance budgets verified on the candidate,** with the measurement method the plan named, numbers recorded.
- **Debug logging defaults OFF in the release candidate.** The switch and the logging code stay in — they are the day-one diagnostic path — but the shipped default generates nothing until the user enables it (the Phase 5 scaffold set it ON for development; this gate flips and verifies the default on the actual candidate).
- Security profile checklist passed (link `docs/security.md`).
- **The self-audit from `references/anti-patterns.md` was run on the candidate**, answer by answer, each backed by a command or an artifact rather than recollection. Every failing answer is fixed before the tag or explicitly accepted by the user in `docs/decisions.md`; the run and its answers go in `docs/07-release.md`. An audit answered from memory is the trap it was written to catch.
- **`docs/threat-model.md` is true of the release being tagged.** Every control still carries its real delivery state — nothing left at `TO BUILD` is described in the present tense anywhere in the docs or the readme — and the "Not defended" table reflects what this version actually does not protect against. A control that shipped this cycle moved to `IN PLACE` with its evidence; one that did not ship moved to the second table with its consequence. Shipping a release whose documentation claims a protection it does not have is a release blocker, not a documentation debt.
- **The change map and the code map are current.** Every `[E]` row in `docs/03-technical-plan.md` exists in the candidate, no `[A]`/`[G]` path that shipped is still marked as pending, and every recurring change type this cycle introduced has its row in the change map (`references/phase-2-functional-spec.md` steps 4 and 4b). `scripts/keel-verify` checks the markers mechanically; the change map is read against this release's diff.
- When the environment provides subagents (per `references/assistant-config.md`), `security-auditor` reviews the final tree before the tag; findings are fixed, or explicitly accepted by the user on the record.
- **This gate's reading verifiers go out together, never in a chain.** `security-auditor` (above) and `guide-qa` (below) read one frozen candidate and share nothing: dispatch them in ONE parallel block and judge the gate against their merged findings, not against whichever answered first (`references/assistant-config.md`, "Parallel fan-out"). Anything that EXECUTES against the candidate runs at its own point in this list — the full driven suite re-run above, the real-environment verification below — one at a time and on the built distributable, never concurrently with another executing pass: two agents holding one environment manufacture failures the release does not have.
- If the end-user guide ships in the package: `guide-qa` re-verifies it on the exact release candidate (when the environment provides subagents — inline otherwise): coverage still matches the release's capabilities, every internal link and image resolves, placeholder-clean — plus the theme checks (`references/guide-theme.md`): version meta = `Docs theme:` card line, `_theme/` intact vs the theme release's checksums.
- If the assistant config package exists (`references/assistant-config.md`): rules/agents still match the recorded conventions and security profile in EVERY accepted tool's container (no drift between containers), the permission allow-lists still match the plan's commands, and the pre-commit gate still blocks a synthetic secret.
- **Accessibility verification (gate — no tag without it for anything with a UI).** Automated checks pass, and a manual pass with the platform's **real assistive technology** — screen reader, keyboard/switch, largest text size, reduced-motion and high-contrast on — succeeds on the **actual distributable** in a real environment, not just in dev. It meets the Phase 1 targeted level (WCAG 2.2 AA floor / AAA where feasible; EN 301 549 / EAA where in scope) or the shortfall is honestly recorded in `docs/accessibility.md` (no overlay, no false conformance claim). Link `docs/accessibility.md`. Per `references/accessibility.md`.
- **Minified assets regenerated from source and in sync.** For anything shipping front-end JS/CSS, regenerate every `*.min.*` from its committed unminified source with the project's build/minify script on the candidate, and verify each pair matches; a stale or hand-edited minified file blocks the release. Run locally — never assume a CI or forge action produced them. Per SKILL.md "Build assets — source first, minified for production" (unless a different pipeline is recorded in `docs/decisions.md`).
- Build the distributable the way the user actually ships it (e.g. `git archive` / the plugin packaging step) and inspect the output: no secrets, no dev files, all runtime files present, correct version.
- **Real-environment verification (hard gate — no tag without it).** "Tests pass" is not "it works when installed". Take the exact distributable a user receives and install/deploy it in a real environment of the correct type — a real WordPress site for a plugin, the actual Fly.io app for a service, a clean target install for a library — then exercise the critical path there. If there's an installed base, also run the real upgrade from the previous shipped version on that environment. **For anything that installs into a host platform (WordPress and WooCommerce plugins above all), the lifecycle is walked whole: install → configure → uninstall → reinstall on a clean environment**, verifying that uninstall removes every option, table, meta key, transient and scheduled event the product creates, and that the reinstall starts genuinely clean rather than inheriting stale state. Orphan rows autoloaded on every request of a site that no longer uses the product, and a reinstall that behaves differently from a first install, are among the hardest support cases to reproduce and they are only ever caught here (trap 14 in `references/anti-patterns.md`). **The support matrix is exercised at both ends** — the playground pinned to the declared floor AND to the current ceiling — so the declared compatibility is tested rather than asserted; an untested "Tested up to" is a false claim made to every user who reads it. Where the environment provides subagents, this is `playground-qa`'s Phase 7 pass and it is the one agent holding the environment while it runs. The Phase 5 playground can serve as this environment when it is of the correct type — but what gets installed in it is the exact distributable, never the dev tree — and `docs/playground.md` (access details, try-it instructions) is what the user follows for their own final pass. A failure here blocks the release; it is never waved through because unit tests were green.
- If UI: faithfulness checklist from `docs/BUILD-SPEC.md` still holds.

### 5. Release artifacts

- Tag the release.
- Produce the distributable package and verify its contents one more time against the intended boundary.
- **A forge release that publishes downloadable assets (a consumption zip, checksums, builds) is verified AFTER publishing, never assumed.** Check the attachments for real — `gh release view <tag>` or the forge API's assets list, confirming each expected asset's name AND size — NEVER by reading the rendered release page: the release body may DESCRIBE its assets, and a description is not an attachment. When the environment has no network or no `gh`, the user runs `gh release view <tag>` from their terminal (or opens the release) and reports the assets list back. Record the verification (asset names + sizes) in `docs/07-release.md`. Missing assets → the release is not shipped: attach them (`gh release upload <tag> <files>` or the release's Edit page) and re-verify.
- **License ships correctly:** the LICENSE file is in the package, file headers carry the license where the platform convention expects it, and every bundled dependency's license is compatible and honored (the Phase 1 decision, checked per dependency in Phase 5). Any code ported from another codebase (Phase 2 `## Reference artifacts`) is covered by the same check: its license compatible, its attribution present where the license requires it.
- Produce/refresh the end-user README and any required store/marketplace metadata. For WordPress.org plugins specifically: `readme.txt` valid (`Requires at least`, `Tested up to` — current WP version actually tested, `Requires PHP`, `Stable tag` = this release), plugin main-file headers in sync, and the assets the listing needs (banner, icon, screenshots with captions).
- Note the release in `docs/` (e.g. append to changelog and a short release note).
- **Close the loop on issues and cost.** If a forge issue log exists (`docs/issues.md`): mark the issues this release closes — entries complete, shipping version recorded — and reference them in the changelog entry where useful. Then run the **final token reconciliation** in `docs/token-ledger.md` (per `references/estimation-budget.md`): total tokens by model, cost at verified current prices, and the deviation vs the estimate — report it to the user plainly, and record the calibration lesson for future estimates in `docs/lessons-learned.md` if significant.
- **Maintenance handoff.** The release is not the end state: from here on the project is in maintenance, and anything that arrives — a bug report, a feature request, a dependency alert, a platform update — follows `references/maintenance.md` (triage, the hotfix path, rollback, the dependency/CVE duty, recurring features, site freshness when a Phase 8 site exists).
- Update `docs/PROGRESS.md`: Phase 7 done, current position "maintenance" (per `references/maintenance.md`), and Phase 8 pending or n/a per the Phase 1 website intent.

## Definition of done

- `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes` (export-ignore) exist, correct for the project type, and the package boundary is agreed with the user.
- No secret is tracked in git; no dev file is in the shipped package; no runtime file is missing from it.
- If the assistant config package exists: verified current against the recorded decisions in every container, and none of it (`.claude/`, `.agents/`, the other tools' config trees, `.githooks/`, `.mcp.json`) ships.
- Version proposed by the assistant and explicitly approved by the user, then set and **identical across every touchpoint** listed in the technical plan; changelog updated oldest → newest.
- The `references/anti-patterns.md` self-audit was run on the candidate with every answer evidenced by a command or an artifact, and every failing answer fixed or accepted on the record; the run is in `docs/07-release.md`.
- `docs/threat-model.md` matches the tagged release: no control described in the present tense that is not `IN PLACE` with its evidence, and the "Not defended" table current for this version.
- The code map's `[E]` markers match the candidate and the change map covers every recurring change type introduced this cycle.
- LICENSE file and headers ship correctly; bundled dependency licenses compatible.
- Distributable built and its contents verified.
- Real-environment verification passed on the actual distributable (and the real upgrade, if there's an installed base).
- The ENTIRE automated suite was re-run on the exact distributable being tagged, command + result recorded in `docs/07-release.md`; `scripts/keel-verify` clean on the candidate; `scripts/keel-doctor --check` passing, with its table recorded, so it is provable that the suite actually ran rather than silently degrading.
- `docs/keel-conformance.md` is current against `MANIFEST.md` at this position: every applicable requirement `present`, `declined` with its decision entry, or `n/a` with its condition — nothing `missing` without a decision, and any pending Table 3 delta from a Keel update applied or explicitly declined.
- Every user-visible acceptance criterion was verified by a driven test on the candidate; every remaining delegation carries one of the eight tags with its steps and its recorded result.
- If the project ships front-end JS/CSS: every `*.min.*` was regenerated from its committed source on the candidate and verified in sync (no hand-edited or stale minified file), or a different pipeline is recorded in `docs/decisions.md`.
- No `⚠ unverified` item rode into the tag: each was re-attempted in the real environment or explicitly accepted by the user in `docs/decisions.md`; zero placeholder copy in the distributable; performance budgets verified on the candidate.
- If the environment provides subagents: `security-auditor` reviewed the final tree, findings fixed or accepted on the record — otherwise its unavailability recorded.
- If the end-user guide shipped in the package: `guide-qa` re-verified it on the candidate (coverage, links, placeholder-clean, theme checks) — or the environment's lack of subagents recorded.
- If the release publishes downloadable assets: their real attachment was verified post-publication (names + sizes via `gh release view` / the forge API, recorded in `docs/07-release.md`) — never assumed from the rendered release page.
- Maintenance handoff noted: PROGRESS.md's position is "maintenance" and future work follows `references/maintenance.md`.
- Accessibility verification passed on the actual distributable for anything with a UI (automated + real assistive-tech), meeting the Phase 1 targeted level or with the shortfall honestly recorded in `docs/accessibility.md`.
- If `docs/issues.md` exists: the issues this release closes are marked resolved with complete entries and the shipping version recorded.
- Final token reconciliation done in `docs/token-ledger.md` (totals by model, cost at verified prices, deviation vs estimate) and reported to the user.
- `docs/07-release.md` complete.

This is the final phase of the build lifecycle; from here the project lives in maintenance (`references/maintenance.md`). Report the release summary to the user.

If Phase 1 recorded project-website intent (yes), proceed to Phase 8 (Project Website) if the user is ready, or remind them Phase 8 can be run later whenever they want the site. Phase 8 is part of this skill — not built here in Phase 7.
