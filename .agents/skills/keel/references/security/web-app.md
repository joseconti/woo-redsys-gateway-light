# Security Profile — Web App / API / Hosted Service

Load this for SPAs, API backends, or hosted services (e.g. on Fly.io). Apply from Phase 1, verify at every Phase 5 test point.

## Input / output

- Validate every input against a strict schema (type, range, length, format). Reject by default; allow-list, don't block-list.
- Encode/escape output for its sink (HTML, attribute, URL, JSON, SQL). Prevent XSS in the client; never `innerHTML` untrusted data.
- Parameterized queries / ORM bindings only — never string-built SQL.
- **SSRF:** if the server fetches user-supplied URLs (webhooks, imports, previews), allow-list destinations and block internal ranges/metadata endpoints (169.254.169.254, localhost, RFC 1918) — never fetch a raw user URL.
- Uploads: validate type/size server-side, store outside the web root or with non-executable permissions, serve with a safe content type.
- Set a strict Content-Security-Policy and the standard security headers (HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, frame-ancestors).

## AuthN / AuthZ

- Strong session/token handling: short-lived access tokens, rotated refresh tokens, secure+httponly+samesite cookies. OAuth 2.1 + PKCE for public clients.
- Authorization checked server-side on every request, per resource and action — never trust the client to hide a button.
- Rate-limit auth endpoints; lock out / back off on brute force; generic auth error messages (don't reveal which factor failed).
- CSRF protection on cookie-authenticated state-changing requests.

## Credential storage & recovery

- Passwords hashed with argon2id (or bcrypt at an adequate cost) — never reversible encryption, never plain, never a homemade scheme.
- Offer MFA (TOTP at minimum); require it as an option for privileged accounts.
- Recovery flows: single-use, time-boxed tokens, stored hashed. No account enumeration — identical response whether the account exists or not.
- Rate-limit login, reset, and every enumeration-prone endpoint.

## Secrets & config

- Secrets only from environment or a secret manager; never in the repo, the image, or client bundles. Verify the client build contains no server secret.
- Separate config per environment; no production secret in dev.
- Rotate-able credentials; document rotation in `docs/security.md`.

## Data

- Encrypt in transit (TLS everywhere) and at rest for sensitive data. Minimize PII; define retention.
- Principle of least privilege for DB and service accounts.
- Log security-relevant events without logging secrets, tokens, or full PII.

## Service / infra (e.g. Fly.io)

- Lock down exposed ports/services to what's needed; no debug endpoints in production.
- Pin and scan dependencies; rebuild on advisories. No known-vulnerable packages shipped.
- Health/liveness endpoints must not leak internal detail.
- Graceful failure: no stack traces or internal config to the client on error.

## Phase test points (verify during Phase 5)

- Every endpoint: schema validation + server-side authz + rate limiting where relevant.
- AuthN flow: token lifetimes, refresh rotation, cookie flags, CSRF on state-changing requests.
- No secret in client bundle or image.
- Security headers + CSP present and effective.
- Error responses leak nothing internal.
- Dependency scan clean.

## Verify with

- Dependency audit per stack: `npm audit` / `composer audit` / `pip-audit`.
- A baseline dynamic scan when feasible (OWASP ZAP baseline).
- Security headers checked with `curl -sI` against the running app.

At a test point, the command and its result are the evidence recorded in `docs/05-test-points.md` — an unrecorded check did not happen.

## Deliberate omissions (seed the "Not defended" table)

This profile hardens what it covers and is silent on the rest. Silence is not protection, so the
project's `docs/threat-model.md` (Phase 2 §4c) carries a "Not defended" table naming what is
deliberately out of scope, its consequence, and what the user would add if their risk profile needs
it. **An omission that is written down is a decision; an omission that is silent is a trap** — six
months on, nobody can tell "we decided against it" from "we forgot".

Start from these rows, keep the ones that apply, add the project's own, and move any row into the
"Defended" table the moment the control actually ships with its evidence:

| Not defended | Consequence | If you need it |
|---|---|---|
| A determined user on their own client | They can read the bundle, extract their own token and call the API directly; client-side validation is UX, never enforcement | Nothing client-side. Authorize every call server-side — attempting a client fix is the trap |
| Volumetric denial of service | Instance limits convert a flood into unavailability rather than an unbounded bill, but the site is down | A WAF or CDN-level rate limiting in front of the app |
| Account takeover through the user's email provider | Password reset is only as strong as the inbox behind it | Enforce MFA |
| Supply-chain provenance | Dependencies are pinned and audited; artifacts are not attested and there is no SBOM | SBOM generation and artifact signing |
| A malicious insider with production access | Least privilege and audit logs reduce the risk; an owner can still do anything | Separated duties and approval on production changes |
| Data at rest beyond the provider's default encryption | Whatever the host encrypts is what is encrypted | Application-level encryption of the specific sensitive fields, with owned key rotation |

Every remaining control in the "Defended" table carries its delivery state — `IN PLACE` (built and
verified), `TO BUILD` (a named slice), `MANUAL` (a human configures it) or `VERIFY` (only a real
environment confirms it) — and only `IN PLACE` may be written in the present tense anywhere in the
project's documentation.
