# Native assistant project configuration — optional package

Load this reference at three moments, and only these: (a) Phase 1 step 0a (or adoption step 2), when the package is OFFERED; (b) the close of Phase 2 (adoption: after its step 4), when rules and agents are MATERIALIZED; (c) the Phase 5 scaffold, when permissions, the pre-commit gate, the MCP registration, and the CI workflow are COMPLETED.

Modern coding assistants load certain project files natively: modular rules (path-scoped where the tool supports it), project subagents, committed permission allow-lists, and MCP server registrations. Keel can generate these from decisions the project has ALREADY made, so sessions running in ANY accepted assistant — Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Windsurf — get the project's conventions, security profile, and quality gates enforced ergonomically, without re-reading the full technical plan into context every time. The principle throughout: **one source of content, one container per assistant** — the substance is identical everywhere; only the file path and frontmatter differ.

## Position in the workflow (read this first)

- **The lock (`CLAUDE.md` + `AGENTS.md`) remains the universal mechanism.** Native config is loaded only by its own tool. Nothing critical to the workflow may live ONLY in a tool's config tree: the lock and the `docs/` state remain the source of truth in every environment. This package is reinforcement and ergonomics, never a replacement.
- **Token economy applies.** Rules without a path/glob filter load into EVERY session's context. Therefore: every generated rule is path-scoped by default (where the tool supports scoping), kept short (target under 40 lines), and points to the authoritative `docs/` file instead of duplicating its body. A rule that restates the whole technical plan is a defect.
- **Content derives from recorded decisions only.** Rules and agents are generated FROM `docs/03-technical-plan.md`, the loaded security profile, and Keel's own quality gates. Never invent new policy inside a rule — if something is worth enforcing, it goes into the plan or `docs/decisions.md` first, then into the rule.
- **Parity across tools is a duty.** When a recorded decision changes a source, EVERY accepted tool's container updates in the same change — two assistants reading different conventions is a defect. This is exactly why the content lives in `docs/` and the containers stay thin.
- **The whole package is optional and per-project.** Offered once, recorded once, never nagged about again.

## The offer (one batched question — Phase 1 step 0a / adoption step 2)

Alongside the existing embed-the-skill question, ask ONCE: (a) **which assistants will work on this repo** — Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, others (any set; solo developers usually name one or two); and (b) whether the project should carry their native configuration, presenting the pieces and their value in two or three lines. The user may take all of it, part of it, or none. Record both in the project card:

```
Assistant config: [none / rules / rules+agents / full] (tools: claude, codex, copilot, cursor, gemini, windsurf, ...)
```

(`full` = rules + agents + permissions + pre-commit gate + MCP registration and the CI workflow when applicable. The gate and CI are tool-agnostic — one each per project, never one per assistant.) Record a D-entry in `docs/decisions.md` with what was accepted. In the same breath, tell the user once that every tool has PERSONAL, non-committed config — `CLAUDE.local.md` and `.claude/settings.local.json` (Claude), a per-directory `AGENTS.override.md` (Codex), user-level directories under `~` (all tools): Keel never creates them (they are the user's own), but always adds the repo-resident ones to `.gitignore` so they can never be committed by accident (see "Personal files and `.gitignore`" below).

When the package includes agents (`rules+agents` or `full`), settle the **model map** in the same conversation — which model plays each role (`orchestrator` / `reviewer` / `mechanical`) — per "Model binding" below: propose it, record it on the card's `Models:` line and as a D-entry, and move on. If no agents are taken, there is no map to set.

Do not block on this question: if the user defers, record `Assistant config: none (deferred)` and move on — the package can be added later from this reference at any phase boundary. Tools not in the accepted list get NOTHING generated: a config tree no tool will read is noise, not coverage. Adding a tool later is a normal recorded change — generate its containers from the same sources at the next phase boundary, and add its card entry.

## Pieces, sources, and timing

| Piece | Generated from | Created at | Updated when |
|-------|----------------|-----------|--------------|
| Rules (one container per accepted tool) | `docs/03-technical-plan.md` §Conventions + the loaded security profile + Keel quality gates | Phase 2 close (adoption: after its step 4) | A recorded decision changes a source — same change, every container, never silently |
| Subagents (per capable tool) | Same sources + `docs/api/INDEX.md` discipline | Phase 2 close (adoption: after its step 4); `launch-verifier` only with website intent — or at Phase 8 start on first need; `guide-qa` only when the end-user guide decision is yes — at Phase 6 on first need | Same rule |
| Permission allow-lists (per capable tool) | Technical plan §Tooling commands + playground commands | Phase 5 scaffold, ALWAYS confirmed with the user | Tooling/playground commands change |
| `.githooks/pre-commit` (one per project) | SKILL.md "Confidential data never reaches Git" | Phase 5 scaffold (adoption: immediately, with approval) | The gate's patterns need tightening (recorded) |
| CI workflow (one per project, e.g. `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) | Technical plan §Tooling commands — the same verified source as the allow-lists | Phase 5 scaffold, if the forge supports CI | The plan's verified commands change |
| MCP registration (per capable tool) | Technical plan — ONLY if it defines development MCP servers | Phase 5 scaffold, confirmed | The dev MCP set changes |
| Model binding (reviewer + mechanical subagents, per capable tool) | The project's role→model map (card `Models:`), captured at the 0a offer | Phase 2 close, with the subagents | The user changes the map, or a configured model becomes unavailable |

Everything in the table is repo-only: Phase 7 marks every generated config tree `export-ignore` alongside the existing workflow files, so none of it ships in the distributable.

## The container matrix — which file, per assistant

| Piece | Claude Code | OpenAI Codex | GitHub Copilot | Cursor | Gemini CLI | Windsurf |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Rules, path-scoped | `.claude/rules/*.md` (frontmatter `paths:`) | nested `AGENTS.md` in each source dir | `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` (frontmatter `applyTo:`) | `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` (frontmatter `globs:`) | nested `GEMINI.md` in each source dir | `.windsurf/rules/*.md` (frontmatter `trigger: glob`) |
| Subagents | `.claude/agents/*.md` | — (inline fallback; optional `[agents.<name>]` roles in `.codex/config.toml`) | `.github/agents/*.agent.md` | `.cursor/agents/*.md` — also reads `.claude/agents/` natively | `.gemini/agents/*.md` | — (inline fallback) |
| Permission allow-list | `.claude/settings.json` | `.codex/rules/*.rules` (trusted projects only) | — (not committable) | `.cursor/cli.json` | `tools.allowed` in `.gemini/settings.json` | — (not committable) |
| MCP servers | `.mcp.json` (repo root) | `[mcp_servers]` in `.codex/config.toml` | `.vscode/mcp.json` | `.cursor/mcp.json` | `mcpServers` in `.gemini/settings.json` | — (user-level only) |
| Model binding, per role | `model:` in `.claude/agents/*.md` | `[agents.<name>]` in `.codex/config.toml` | `model:` in `.github/agents/*.agent.md` | reads `.claude/agents/` natively (else `.cursor/agents/*.md`) | `model:` in `.gemini/agents/*.md` | — (inline fallback, session model) |

Notes the generators must respect:

- **A "—" cell removes the mechanism, never the duty.** No subagents → the session runs the same checks inline and says so (the standing fallback). No committable allow-list → the verified commands are documented in the repo's development notes (e.g. the README's development section) instead. No repo MCP file → the server setup goes in `docs/playground.md` for the user to register at user level.
- **Size limits:** Codex reads roughly the first 32 KiB of combined `AGENTS.md` content by default; Windsurf caps a rule file at 12,000 characters; Cursor recommends rules under 500 lines; Copilot caps an agent file at 30,000 characters. Keel's under-40-lines rule keeps every generated piece far inside all of them — the limits matter only if the user asks for more.
- **Syntax rots.** Every one of these tools evolves its config format continuously. The CONTENT below is Keel's contract; the container is the tool's. When in doubt about a frontmatter key or file location, verify against the tool's current documentation rather than guessing.
- **Gemini CLI and the lock:** Gemini reads `GEMINI.md`, not `AGENTS.md`, by default. When Gemini is an accepted tool, the lock section of `references/project-state.md` already covers it (a `GEMINI.md` mirror, or `context.fileName` in `.gemini/settings.json` including `AGENTS.md` — the user's pick, recorded). The nested-rules mechanism here uses whichever context filename that decision fixed.

## Rules — three rules' worth of content, one container per tool

Generate exactly these three rules by default (more only on explicit user request). The canonical content templates below are written once; materialize one copy per accepted tool in its container from the matrix, adapting ONLY the frontmatter/scoping mechanism. Scope every rule to the source globs from the technical plan's code map (e.g. `includes/**/*.php`, `src/**/*.ts`) so they load only when code is actually touched.

**`code-style`** — the conventions, distilled:

```markdown
---
paths:
  - "[source globs from the code map]"
---

# Code style — [Project name]

Source of truth: docs/03-technical-plan.md §Conventions. On any conflict, the plan wins — fix this file.

- Prefix/namespace: every function, class, option, and hook uses `[prefix]`.
- Naming: [the recorded patterns — functions / classes / files / hooks].
- Error handling: [the ONE recorded strategy]. Never mix strategies.
- Logging: [mechanism + levels]; never log secrets.
- Base language of source strings: English ([i18n mechanism + text domain per the plan]).
- Comments: every public surface carries its docblock in [the platform's convention — e.g. PHPDoc / JSDoc / docstrings] (purpose, params, return); comment the why on non-obvious decisions, not the what. English by default, per the recorded language policy.
```

**`security`** — the loaded profile, distilled to its DO/DON'T core (about ten bullets maximum — e.g. for WordPress: sanitize input, escape output at print time, nonce + capability on every state change, `$wpdb->prepare`, ABSPATH guard, no secrets in code or logs). End with: `Full profile: the Keel security reference for this project type governs; this file is the reminder, not the standard.`

**`docs-discipline`** — Keel's build gates where they bite:

```markdown
---
paths:
  - "[source globs from the code map]"
---

# Build discipline — [Project name]

- Before writing ANY new function/method/class: grep docs/api/INDEX.md first; reuse or generalize an existing fit — a near-duplicate is a defect.
- Every public surface is documented at the moment it changes, in the same slice: created — documented in docs/api/ or docs/reference/ AND its INDEX.md row added, with a runnable example; modified — its existing doc, its example and (if affected) its INDEX row updated to the as-built signature, params, return, errors and permissions; removed — doc and row deleted if it was never released, or marked deprecated/removed with its replacement if it was.
- [Extensible types only:] user-facing strings filterable, before/after actions on decisions, filterable queries/responses, prefixed.
- Update docs/PROGRESS.md and docs/decisions.md at the moment of change, never later.
```

Per-container adaptation (content identical, header differs):

- **Claude Code** — as written above (`paths:` list in the frontmatter).
- **Cursor** — `.cursor/rules/<name>.mdc` with `description: [one line]`, `globs: [the same globs]`, `alwaysApply: false`.
- **Copilot** — `.github/instructions/<name>.instructions.md` with `applyTo: "[the same globs, comma-separated]"`.
- **Windsurf** — `.windsurf/rules/<name>.md` with `trigger: glob` and `globs: [the same globs]`.
- **Codex / Gemini CLI** — no glob mechanism exists: place ONE nested context file (`AGENTS.md` for Codex, the project's context filename for Gemini) in each top-level source directory from the code map (e.g. `includes/`, `src/`), containing the three rules' content concatenated, headed by `Scope: this directory's code.` Do NOT also duplicate the content into the root lock — nested files load only when that directory is touched, which is the whole point.

## Subagents — nine project verifiers, defined once

The canonical definitions are markdown files with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `tools`). Give them read-only tools (`Read, Grep, Glob`) — they flag, they never fix; the verifiers that must EXECUTE to verify (run the playground, fetch the deployed site, run accessibility tooling) add `Bash`/`WebFetch` on top and still never write — with exactly one exception: `test-driver` mechanically adapts the test scaffolding (selectors, waits, fixtures) and nothing else, never product code and never acceptance criteria, so it is the only agent here that carries a write tool. Do NOT hand-write a `model:` string here and NEVER put a model name in the skill — the model is chosen per project, by ROLE, and materialized into each container's native model field from the project's recorded map (see "Model binding" below). The `description` must say WHEN to use the agent — every tool that supports project subagents delegates based on it.

Materialize into each capable container from the matrix: `.claude/agents/*.md` (Claude Code — and Cursor reads this tree natively, so when Cursor is accepted ALONGSIDE Claude, one tree serves both; generate `.cursor/agents/` only when Cursor is accepted without Claude), `.github/agents/<name>.agent.md` (Copilot), `.gemini/agents/*.md` (Gemini CLI). The frontmatter keys are near-identical across the three (name, description, tools); adapt mechanically, never fork the body. Codex has no markdown project subagents — its sessions run the checks inline (the fallback below); optionally, delegation-only roles can be declared in `.codex/config.toml` if the user wants them. Windsurf: inline fallback.

All of them materialize together at Phase 2 close (adoption: after its step 4), except `launch-verifier` — generated only when Phase 1 recorded website intent, or at Phase 8 start on first need — and `guide-qa` — generated at Phase 6 on first need, once the end-user guide decision is yes (the decision does not exist earlier). The conditional agents (`design-fidelity-auditor`, `playground-qa`, `launch-verifier`, `a11y-auditor`, `guide-qa`, `test-driver`) are generated only for projects meeting their condition — an agent the project can never use is noise, not coverage.

**`code-reviewer.md`**:

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews a slice or diff of [Project name] against the recorded conventions and Keel quality gates. Use after completing a slice, before its commit.
tools: Read, Grep, Glob
---

You review code for [Project name] against its recorded contracts. You flag; you never rewrite.

Check in order: (1) conventions per docs/03-technical-plan.md §Conventions — prefix, naming, error handling, logging; (2) reuse — no near-duplicate of anything in docs/api/INDEX.md; (3) i18n — no hardcoded or concatenated user-facing strings; (4) accessibility on UI slices, per the project's targeted level; (5) docs — every public surface the diff adds has its doc AND its INDEX.md row, every surface the diff changes has its doc updated to match (a doc describing the previous signature is a finding), and every surface the diff removes leaves no doc or row describing a symbol that no longer exists; (6) extension points on extensible types; (7) comments — every public surface in the diff carries its docblock per the platform's convention (purpose, params, return), non-obvious decisions carry a why comment, and comment language follows the recorded policy (English by default).

Report: file:line — what fails — which recorded rule it violates. Order by severity. If everything passes, say so in one line.
```

**`security-auditor.md`** — same skeleton; description: "Audits changes against the [type] security profile. Use before any commit touching input handling, auth, data writes, or external calls." Body: the distilled profile checklist (same ten bullets as the rule), plus: verify no secret, credential, key, or real personal data appears in the changed files. Report file:line + risk + rule.

**`docs-verifier.md`** — same skeleton; description: "Verifies docs/api/INDEX.md and docs/api/ + docs/reference/ are one-to-one. Use at test points and sprint closes." Body: every INDEX row has its doc; every doc has its row; every public surface in the diff appears in both; examples reference symbols that exist. Check all three operations in the diff, not only additions: a surface **added** has its doc and its row; a surface whose signature, parameters, return, errors, or permissions **changed** has its doc updated in the same diff (a doc still describing the previous signature is a finding); a surface **removed** leaves no doc or row describing a symbol the code no longer has — unless it is a released surface deliberately marked deprecated/removed with its replacement. Report mismatches as slice defects.

**`design-fidelity-auditor.md`** — UI projects only; same skeleton, read-only. description: "Verifies the built UI against docs/BUILD-SPEC.md and the design handoff, screen by screen. Use at Phase 4 Step 7 (the fidelity walk) and whenever fidelity is in doubt." Body: read `docs/BUILD-SPEC.md`, `docs/design/design-handoff/`, and the built UI code; verify per screen: (1) computed/token values against the BUILD-SPEC token table (§3), (2) every state row of the state matrix (§4) present and reachable, (3) every asset referenced without build-side transformation. Report screen + file:line — expected vs built. Findings become defects or Design Requests — never silently fixed.

**`playground-qa.md`** — projects with a playground; skeleton plus `Bash` (it executes, it never edits). description: "Runs docs/playground.md literally, with fresh context. Use at sprint closes and at the Phase 7 gate." Body: receive ONLY `docs/playground.md` and follow it to the letter — start commands, every try-it flow, teardown. Report every point where reality diverges from the document: a command that fails, a step that assumes unstated context, a flow that dead-ends. An instruction gap is a defect exactly like a code bug — the document, not the reader, gets fixed.

**`launch-verifier.md`** — website projects (Phase 8); skeleton plus `Bash`/`WebFetch` (it fetches, it never edits). description: "Crawls the deployed site and returns the launch verification table. Use at the Phase 8 launch checklist." Body: from `sitemap.xml`, fetch every page; parse every head (title, description, OG — present and unique per page); validate the JSON-LD; fetch the well-known files; check the security headers. Report the pass/fail table that feeds `<site-docs>/launch-report.md`, one row per check with its evidence.

**`a11y-auditor.md`** — UI and website projects; skeleton plus `Bash` (it runs tooling, it never edits). description: "Runs the automated accessibility pass and prepares the guided assistive-technology script. Use before Phase 4's definition of done and at the Phase 8 launch checklist." Body: run the automated pass (axe-core / pa11y / the platform inspectors) across the screens or the full sitemap URL list, recording command + result; prepare the step-by-step script for the guided assistive-technology pass the user will run (the guided loop in `references/accessibility.md`). Report findings by severity; automated coverage is partial by design — the guided pass closes the rest.

**`test-driver.md`** — any project with a runnable surface; skeleton plus `Bash`, `Edit`, and, where the environment exposes them, the browser/automation tools (no container's `tools:` line can express a path scope, so the scope is stated in the agent's BODY — test scaffolding only — and, where the accepted tool's allow-list can express write paths, scoped there too — see "Permission allow-lists" below; where it cannot, the body scope is the only control and that is recorded rather than implied) (it executes tests and mechanically adapts them — selectors, waits, fixtures — but never authors acceptance criteria or new assertions, and never changes product code). Bound to the **mechanical** role: it executes what the acceptance criteria already specify, so the cheapest capable model is the right one — see "Model binding" below. description: "Drives the product's interfaces end to end — fills fields, walks branches, asserts what the UI shows — and returns the evidence. Use at every Phase 5 test point, at sprint closes, and at the Phase 7 gate." Body: read `docs/03-technical-plan.md` §Testing (the driver per surface, the addressability convention, the division of labour) and `references/test-automation.md`; run `scripts/keel-doctor --check` first and stop with its table if anything blocking is missing; then, for the slice or release under test, drive every user-visible acceptance criterion — each field filled valid, empty and invalid, each branch walked including failure and recovery, each assertion made against what the interface actually shows; collect console errors, uncaught exceptions, failed requests, 5xx responses and the platform log, and fail on any of them; run the static analysers and sniffers named in §Tooling commands; run the automated accessibility pass per screen AND per state. Report one row per criterion with its command, its result and the path to its evidence artifact, plus the exhaustive list of legs that could NOT be driven, each with one of the eight tags in `references/test-automation.md` and the steps whoever runs it will follow. **Never report a criterion as passing because a human said so, and never propose that the user walk a flow this agent could have driven** — a delegation without a tag is a finding against this agent, not against the product.

**`guide-qa.md`** — projects with an end-user guide (the Phase 6 decision is yes, not declined); same skeleton, read-only. description: "Verifies the end-user guide (guide/) against the product's capability and settings lists, with fresh context. Use at the Phase 6 guide check and at the Phase 7 gate when the guide ships in the package." Body: receive ONLY `guide/` plus the v1 capability list (`docs/01-discovery.md` / `docs/02-functional-spec.md`), the settings list (`docs/usage/configuration.md`), the project card's `Docs theme:` line, the theme release's `checksums.txt`, and `docs/api/INDEX.md` when the developer portal exists; verify: (1) mechanical coverage — every capability and every setting has its guide section, and troubleshooting covers the debug-log switch; (2) every internal link and image resolves inside `guide/` — nothing external, per the offline rule; (3) every task's steps are followable exactly as written — no step assumes context the guide never gave; (4) per-locale orthography is perfect and secondary locales mirror the principal's structure; (5) the guide's own HTML meets the accessibility basics (semantic structure, heading outline, alt text on every image); (6) the canonical-theme checks per `references/guide-theme.md` — every page carries `<meta name="keel-docs-theme">` equal to the project card's `Docs theme:` line, `guide/_theme/` matches the theme release's `checksums.txt` (SHA-256 recomputed; an edited `_theme/` is a defect whose fix goes upstream to the theme repo, never a local fork), and dev-portal coverage vs `docs/api/INDEX.md` is one-to-one when the portal exists. Report each gap as a Phase 6 defect — the guide, never the reader, gets fixed.

### Domain rubrics — handing a reviewer explicit criteria

Every verifier above checks against something already fixed: the recorded conventions, the security profile, the SPEC, a mechanical checklist. When a project records a **rubric** — a short criteria set for one judgment domain, decided with the user at Phase 2 §6a and living in `docs/rubrics/<domain>.md` — a reviewer subagent may additionally be handed it and asked to score the work against it. The mechanism is not new: `a11y-auditor` already does exactly this with `references/accessibility.md`.

The rules that govern rubrics are stated where they are authored (`references/phase-2-functional-spec.md` §6a): recorded never improvised, the reviewer flags and never rewrites, and the fixed artifact wins any disagreement. On the agent side this adds one constraint of its own: **`design-fidelity-auditor` is never a rubric consumer.** Its job is faithfulness to `docs/BUILD-SPEC.md`; making it a judge of taste would license exactly the build-side deviation the handoff contract exists to prevent. Rubrics belong to authoring, not to fidelity checking.

No rubric on record means the agents run as before — rubrics are opt-in depth, never a gate.

This file DEFINES the agents; the phase references INVOKE them: the Phase 1 competitor scan, the Phase 2 §6a spec review, Phase 4 Step 7, Phase 5 test points and sprint closes, the Phase 6 guide check, the Phase 7 gate, the Phase 8 launch checklist. If the environment provides no subagents (Codex, Windsurf, or any tool without them), the session runs the same checks inline and says so — the check never disappears with the mechanism.

## Parallel fan-out — verifiers run at once, never in a chain

Every agent above flags and never rewrites the product's code, docs or specs — `test-driver`'s scoped adaptations to test scaffolding are the one exception, and the fourth serial case below is what keeps them safe. Independent checks over a tree nobody is modifying have no reason to wait for each other, and chaining them multiplies the wall-clock of every gate by the number of checks — four chained verifiers cost four times the wait for exactly the same answer. **So the default is parallel and serial is the exception, which must justify itself against the four cases below.** This is the same rule the lock states for tool calls (`Batch independent tool calls in ONE parallel block`), applied to delegation.

**The split that makes it safe: reading verifiers versus executing ones.** `code-reviewer`, `security-auditor`, `docs-verifier`, `guide-qa` and `design-fidelity-auditor` only read (`Read, Grep, Glob`): any number of them run together, always — the fidelity auditor included, because it reads the captures a preceding executing pass produced rather than driving the browser itself (see capture-once below). `playground-qa`, `test-driver`, `a11y-auditor` and `launch-verifier` also EXECUTE — they boot the playground, drive the suite, run the tooling, crawl the deployed site — and executing means holding a shared environment: containers, ports, one database, one seed dataset, one origin. Two of those against the SAME environment is not parallelism, it is contention, and it manufactures defects the product does not have: a `playground-qa` teardown landing mid-suite makes `test-driver` report connection failures and 5xx, which the rules then oblige it to fail on.

**Where the per-unit check needs a running environment, split it in two: capture once, compare in parallel.** ONE pass — the session's own, or whichever executing agent already holds the environment — produces the artifacts (the rendered screens at the declared breakpoints, the crawl output, the tooling report), and the per-unit agents then read those artifacts concurrently as readers. That is what makes a twelve-screen fidelity walk one round instead of twelve without putting twelve agents on one browser, and it is why a reading verifier can cover work whose evidence had to be executed for.

Two kinds of fan-out, both mandatory wherever they apply:

1. **Different verifiers at the same gate** — dispatch every READING verifier the gate calls for in ONE parallel block, never one after another, with at most ONE executing verifier per environment running alongside them. A Phase 5 sprint close reads with `docs-verifier` while `playground-qa` holds the playground; the Phase 7 gate reads with `security-auditor` and `guide-qa` together; a Phase 5 test point sends `code-reviewer` out with whatever else that slice's gate reads for. Dispatch only what the project actually has — six of the nine agents are conditional, and an agent that was never generated is not a gap in the block.
2. **One verifier over many independent units** — when a verifier's work is the same check repeated over units that do not depend on each other, dispatch one agent per unit in the same parallel block instead of one agent walking the list. Screens for the Phase 4 fidelity walk (over captures, per the capture-once rule above), locales for the `guide-qa` per-locale checks, audit dimensions for the adoption gap audit, rubric domains for a Phase 2 §6a review where the rubric is already on record, competitors for the Phase 1 scan — where this pattern was already the rule, and is the precedent for the rest. **A per-unit split never silently drops the checks that are cross-unit:** where the verifier also holds a whole-artifact check (the guide's secondary-locale mirroring, its theme checksums, its dev-portal coverage), one additional agent takes those, or the check disappears with the split and nobody notices.

The four cases where serial is correct, and no others:

- **One check's input is another's output.** Rare among readers, since they all read the same recorded artifacts, but real when a finding changes what the next check should look at.
- **Two executing verifiers would share one environment.** Only one holds the playground, the test machine, the seed database or the deployed origin at a time; the others queue behind it while the reading block runs alongside. Where two genuinely must hit one origin (Phase 8's `launch-verifier` and `a11y-auditor`), they may share the block — but any `429` or `5xx` is re-verified single-threaded before it becomes a finding, because a throttled request and a broken page look identical in a report.
- **An agent in the set can change what the readers are reading.** `test-driver` is the only one — its mechanical adaptations to selectors, waits and fixtures — and only on a run where it actually adapts something: then it runs FIRST and alone, and the reading block starts once it has finished. A run that only executes and emits its evidence artifacts does not qualify; nobody reviews the artifacts directory.
- **The environment caps concurrency**, or the user asked for one check at a time. Then run what the cap allows per block — still batched, never one by one.

**File isolation does not buy environment isolation, so it never dissolves the second case.** Where a harness offers to run each agent in its own git worktree, what that isolates is FILES: two agents editing the same path stop colliding. The serial case above is not about files — it is about two EXECUTING verifiers sharing one port, one database, one seed dataset, one deployed origin, and two worktrees fight over all four exactly as two directories in one checkout would. "One executing verifier per environment" therefore stays a serial stage whatever the isolation mechanism offers, and an isolated worktree is never the reason to relax it.

**Merging is the main session's job and it is not optional.** Each agent returns findings for its own slice of the work and nothing else; the session collects every block's results, deduplicates findings several agents raised against the same `file:line`, and reports once. A gate is passed against the merged set — never against the first agent that answered, and never against a partial set because one agent is still running.

### Workflows — the same fan-out, written as a script

Some environments expose a further primitive: a **workflow**, a script that dispatches agents deterministically — loops, conditions, per-unit fan-out, and a merge step that is code rather than discipline. Where one exists it does not change any rule above; it changes who enforces them. The rule stays "one agent per independent unit, merged before the verdict"; the script is what makes forgetting impossible.

**Keel never depends on it.** A workflow tool requires the user's explicit opt-in, may simply not exist in the environment, and carries a user-controlled size cap Keel does not govern (a session may be told to keep workflows under a given number of agents). That is the same situation as subagents, so it takes the same shape of answer: a fallback chain, not a requirement.

**The fallback chain, three steps, all producing the same table:**

> **workflow** (where one exists AND the user has opted in) → **parallel subagent block** (where subagents exist) → **inline and serial**.

Only the wall clock changes between them. None of the three drops a check, and none of them is a licence to trim the set: an environment without the first two runs every check inline and says so, exactly as the standing fallback already requires.

**The canonical candidate is the conformance sweep** (SKILL.md "Applying Keel completely"). The rows of `MANIFEST.md` Table 1 plus Table 3's per-version delta are an enumerable list of independent units checked the same way — the textbook one-verifier-over-many-units case. Measured on a real project: 31 rows, 5 agents, 110 seconds, and no hallucination found when the evidence was contrasted against the disk; the `docs/decisions.md` citations in the `declined` rows were correct. The same shape fits the other enumerable units the rule already names: screens in the Phase 4 fidelity walk (over captures, per capture-once), locales in `guide-qa`, dimensions in the adoption gap audit, rubric domains at Phase 2 §6a, competitors in the Phase 1 scan.

**What a schema buys, stated honestly.** With a per-row output schema, the rows arrive validated at the tool layer and **no model sits between the data and the file** — nothing rewrites, summarises or reformats a verdict on its way to `docs/keel-conformance.md`. But two pieces are still needed and they are not "the schema":

1. **A deterministic template in the script** — `rows.map(r => "| … |")`, about six lines, no model, reproducible. That is code, not post-processing, and it has to be written.
2. **A way to reach the disk**, because the workflow script itself has no filesystem access. Either a writing agent handed the finished markdown and forbidden to change a word, or — cleaner, and one agent cheaper — the workflow **RETURNS** the markdown and the main session writes it with its own file tool.

So "no post-processing" means no MODEL in the middle. It does not mean no code.

**Three things stop being discipline and become code:**

- **Dedup and merge.** "Merging is the main session's job" becomes a deterministic function over the collected findings — deduplicating by `file:line` in the script, not by a model asked to be careful, and not omittable.
- **The concurrency cap.** Native to the primitive; there is nothing to write.
- **The cross-unit check.** "A per-unit split never silently drops the checks that are cross-unit" becomes one additional agent, visible in the script beside the per-unit ones instead of trusted to whoever wrote the dispatch.

**And the sweep's own prohibition travels unchanged:** a workflow's agents may read the disk, `MANIFEST.md` and `docs/decisions.md`, and **never the previous `docs/keel-conformance.md`** — the failure that made the rule was found in exactly this modality, where agents cited the last sweep as evidence for their own verdicts.

**What does not become a script, and saying so is part of the rule:**

- **Which verifiers a gate calls for.** Six of the nine agents are conditional on what the project has; that is read off the project card, not enumerated in a script.
- **The reader/executor split and one-executor-per-environment.** A script can *implement* it as a serial stage; *deciding* which agent executes and which environment it holds is judgment — and file isolation does not help, per the note above.
- **`test-driver`'s ordering exception.** "First and alone, but only on a run that actually adapts something" depends on the outcome of that run; the two stages are expressible, the condition is not.
- **The gate's verdict.** A workflow returns the merged set. Passing the gate remains the session's call.

Where the environment provides no subagents (Codex, Windsurf, or any tool without them), the checks run inline and therefore serially. That is a property of the environment, not a licence to drop any of them: record it exactly as the standing fallback already requires.

## Model binding — abstract roles, concrete models per project

Keel runs on many assistants, each with its own model names (Claude's `haiku`/`sonnet`/`opus`, OpenAI's GPT and o-series, Gemini's Pro/Flash, and so on) that keep changing. So **the skill never names a model.** It assigns every agent an abstract ROLE by the kind of work it does; the concrete model behind each role is chosen once per project, in the assistant's own config, from what the user actually has. Same define-once / materialize-per-tool pattern as rules and subagents — one more column in the matrix.

**Three roles, by work type:**

- **orchestrator** — the session driver and the judgment-heavy phases (Discovery, functional/technical plan, architecture, design decisions). Wants the strongest model available.
- **reviewer** — `code-reviewer`, `security-auditor`, `design-fidelity-auditor`. Real judgment, but a mid model handles it; escalate a single audit to the strongest only when that audit demands it.
- **mechanical** — `docs-verifier`, `playground-qa`, `launch-verifier`, `a11y-auditor`, `guide-qa`, `test-driver`, plus any search/exploration agent. They compare, run tooling, and report; the cheapest capable model is the correct one.

**Testing splits across two roles, and conflating them is expensive in both directions.** *Deciding what to test* — reading the acceptance criteria, choosing the cases, working out what "invalid" means for this field, writing the assertions — is authoring, and it belongs to **orchestrator** (or **reviewer** when a whole suite is being reviewed rather than written). *Running the tests and reporting what happened* — booting the environment, executing the suite, driving the recorded flows, collecting evidence, triaging failures into "the product broke" versus "the test broke" — is **mechanical**, and running it on the strongest model buys nothing: the work is executing commands and comparing output against expectations that were already written down. So `test-driver` is bound to **mechanical** by default. Escalate a single run to **reviewer** only when a failure resists diagnosis, or when the driver is being asked to *design* the missing cases rather than execute existing ones — and escalate that run, not the binding.

The practical effect on a real project is large: test runs are the most repeated agent invocation in Phase 5 (every slice, every sprint close, every session's freshness check), so this is the binding where a cheaper model pays back most often — in speed and rate-limit headroom on a subscription, in direct spend on metered billing.

**Recommend, don't interrogate.** When the config package is offered (Phase 1 step 0a / adoption step 2) and at least `rules+agents` is taken, ask in the same breath which models the accepted tool(s) expose — or which tiers the user has — then PROPOSE a role→model map with a one-line reason per role and let the user confirm or override. If the user does not engage, apply the tool's sensible default (strongest → orchestrator, mid → reviewer, cheapest → mechanical) and record it. Never block on this.

**Say why honestly.** On a flat subscription (Claude, ChatGPT, and the like) the marginal token cost is ≈ 0, so dropping a role to a cheaper model buys SPEED and rate-limit headroom, not money — say that. On API or metered billing it is direct spend. Recommend on the axis that actually applies to the user's billing, never a euro saving that a subscription does not produce.

**Persist in three places, each with its job:**

1. `docs/decisions.md` — a D-entry with the chosen map and the reasoning (the audit trail).
2. The project card `Models:` line (`references/project-state.md`) — so every session reads the map on resume without re-deriving it.
3. The tool's native agent config — the ONLY place a concrete model name appears: `model:` in `.claude/agents/*.md`, an `[agents.<name>]` entry in `.codex/config.toml`, `model:` in `.github/agents/*.agent.md` and `.gemini/agents/*.md`. The **orchestrator** model is simply the session model the user launches the tool with (Keel does not set it); the binding governs the **reviewer** and **mechanical** subagents.

**Never let a concrete model name reach the skill, the lock (`CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`), or any file that travels** — those stay portable across tools. Model names live only in the project-local agent configs and the project card. A "—" subagents cell (Codex, Windsurf) has no binding to materialize: the inline fallback runs on the session model, exactly as it already does.

**Re-confirm only on demand or on failure.** The map is recorded once. Revisit it only when the user asks, or when a configured model errors as unavailable — then warn and re-map, recording the change. Re-asking every session is the noise Keel avoids.

## Permission allow-lists — minimal, ALWAYS confirmed

Committed permissions affect every person and session that opens the repo, so these files are never written silently: build the proposed allow-list ONLY from the technical plan's verified tooling commands and the playground's documented start/stop commands, show it to the user, and write it only on their confirmation — once per accepted tool that supports a committable list. One entry does not come from the tooling commands: where the tool's allow-list can express write paths, scope `test-driver`'s write permission to the project's test directories (`Edit(<test-dir>/**)` in Claude Code's shape) — that is the only mechanical enforcement of the test-scaffolding-only limit its `tools:` line cannot express. Where the tool has no such expression, say so on the record instead of describing a control the project does not have.

**Claude Code** — `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(composer test:*)",
      "Bash(wp-env start)",
      "Bash(wp-env stop)"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Gemini CLI** — the same commands as `tools.allowed` entries in `.gemini/settings.json` (e.g. `"run_shell_command(composer test)"`). **Cursor** — the same commands under `permissions.allow` in `.cursor/cli.json` (CLI sessions; the IDE keeps permissions at user level). **Codex** — `prefix_rule` entries in `.codex/rules/*.rules`, `decision = "allow"`, one per verified command prefix; note to the user that Codex applies repo config only to projects the user has marked trusted. **Copilot / Windsurf** — no committable equivalent: document the verified commands in the repo's development notes instead.

**The allow-list must actually cover the driven tests, or the protocol quietly reverts to asking the user.** Build it from the same source as everything else — the technical plan's verified commands — and make sure it includes: the playground start/stop/reset commands, the test-driver invocations for every surface (the browser runner, the platform test command, the protocol driver), the static analysers and sniffers, `scripts/keel-verify`, and `scripts/keel-doctor` in its `--check` and `--plan` modes. **`scripts/keel-doctor --fix` is deliberately NOT allow-listed**: installing software on the user's machine is exactly the kind of action that should stop and ask every time. A driver command missing from the list means the assistant hits a prompt mid-run, and the path of least resistance becomes handing the flow back to the user — which is the failure this whole mechanism exists to prevent. Review the list whenever the plan adds a surface or a driver.

**This section governs the COMMITTED list only.** The machine-local `.claude/settings.local.json` that the session-start permission-mode step writes is a different file with a different rule — see "Personal files and `.gitignore`" below and `references/keel-maintenance.md` ("Permission mode"). Note also that an allow-list is only half the answer: in `manual` mode a composite command (a variable, `&&`, `;`, a pipe) does not match these entries at all, however carefully they are written — which is why resolving the permission mode comes first and why Keel never prefixes a command with `export PATH=... &&`.

Rules for every tool: exact commands or tight prefixes only — never a catch-all wildcard, never a deny-list pretending to be a policy. Permission-rule syntax evolves with each tool; when in doubt, verify against the current settings documentation rather than guessing. If the user wants no committed permissions, skip the files entirely — their absence is a valid state.

## The confidential-data pre-commit gate — `.githooks/pre-commit`

The assistant's own pre-commit check (SKILL.md "Confidential data never reaches Git") still runs in every session — this hook is the NET under it, and it also covers commits made outside Keel sessions (the user's own terminal, another tool). A classic git hook was chosen deliberately over an assistant-specific hook: it fires in EVERY environment and editor — Claude Code, Codex, Copilot, Cursor, Gemini, Windsurf, a bare terminal — which is exactly Keel's portability principle. One gate per project, never one per assistant.

Install at the scaffold: commit the script at `.githooks/pre-commit` (executable), run `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`, and record in the project card that the gate is active. `core.hooksPath` is per-clone: document the one-line setup in the project's developer notes (e.g. the repo README's development section) so collaborators run it too. Then VERIFY the gate: stage a synthetic secret, confirm the commit is blocked, and remove the synthetic file. Assemble the synthetic secret when creating the test file — an `api_key`-style assignment (equals sign, then `sk-` plus at least 20 letters); this reference deliberately never writes that assignment verbatim, so the skill's own files never trip the gate. An unverified gate is not a gate.

```sh
#!/bin/sh
# Keel confidential-data gate — blocks commits that stage secrets.
# Rule source: Keel SKILL.md "Confidential data never reaches Git".
# Bypass policy: fix the finding, or record the user's explicit OK in
# docs/decisions.md and repeat that single commit with --no-verify.

Commit stopped by the Keel confidential-data gate.
A staged file looks like it carries secrets, credentials, keys, or real
personal data. Options, in order:
  1. Unstage it and add it to .gitignore (never tracked).
  2. Already tracked: git rm --cached <file> + .gitignore, commit the removal.
  3. Ever pushed: purge it from history (git filter-repo / BFG) AND rotate
     the credential — ignoring it is not enough.
  4. Genuinely safe (placeholders, sandbox keys meant to ship): record the

     with --no-verify.

```

False positives are kept rare by design — field-tested: (1) the gate itself exempts the canonical trees that legitimately contain the very patterns it searches for, `.githooks/` (its own script) and the embedded skill (`.claude/skills/` and `.agents/skills/`, including this reference), while the assistant-side check still scans them like everything else; (2) never CREATE a false positive when writing — in `docs/decisions.md`, `docs/lessons-learned.md`, comments, or any project note, a secret-shaped string is described or split apart (`api` + `_key`), never pasted verbatim (SKILL.md "Confidential data never reaches Git", point 5). The occasional remaining case (e.g. a legitimate `class-secrets-manager.php`) is handled by the conscious bypass policy above, on the record. Never loosen the patterns to avoid a one-time bypass. If the user also wants an assistant-side hook on top (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and Cursor all offer native pre-tool-use hooks that can gate `git commit`), add it for their accepted tools — but the git hook is the baseline and never replaced by it.

## The CI workflow — conditional, forge-side

Generated at the Phase 5 scaffold when the package was accepted and the project's forge supports CI (GitHub Actions or the forge's equivalent). ONE workflow, running on push and on pull request: install → lint → build → the FULL test suite — the technical plan's EXACT verified commands, the same verified source as the permission allow-lists, never invented — plus a secret scan (gitleaks) and `scripts/keel-verify`. A command that is not in the plan and verified does not enter the workflow.

Why it exists when the pre-commit gate already does: the gate is per-clone (`core.hooksPath` is configured checkout by checkout) — CI is the net that fires in every environment, on every push, including commits made where no hook and no Keel session was present. That is exactly the portability argument this file already makes for the gate, one level up.

## MCP registration — conditional, per capable tool

Create it ONLY when `docs/03-technical-plan.md` defines MCP servers used during development (e.g. the project's own MCP server under test, or a WordPress content MCP for the playground). Confirm with the user before writing. Register the same server set once per accepted tool that supports a repo-level file, per the container matrix.

**Claude Code** — `.mcp.json` at the repo root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "[server-name]": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "[package]"],
      "env": { "API_KEY": "${PROJECT_API_KEY}" }
    }
  }
}
```

**Cursor** — the same object in `.cursor/mcp.json`. **Copilot / VS Code** — the same servers under the `servers` key in `.vscode/mcp.json`. **Gemini CLI** — the same servers under `mcpServers` in `.gemini/settings.json`. **Codex** — `[mcp_servers.<name>]` tables in `.codex/config.toml` (trusted projects). **Windsurf** — no repo-level file: put the server setup in `docs/playground.md` for the user to register at user level.

Hard rule, every container: NEVER a literal secret — each tool's environment-expansion form only (e.g. `${VAR}`; adapt to the container's syntax), with the variable documented in `docs/playground.md`. If a tool offers no expansion mechanism for a needed secret, that server is NOT committed for that tool — user-level registration instead. Every MCP file passes through the same confidential-data gate as everything else. If the project needs no dev MCP servers, these files simply do not exist — do not create empty ones.

## Personal files and `.gitignore`

Unconditional entries (they apply even when the whole package was declined): `CLAUDE.local.md`, `.claude/settings.local.json`, `.keel-update-check`, and `docs/continuation-prompt.md`. Per accepted tool, add its repo-resident personal/transient files: `AGENTS.override.md` (Codex — the user's personal per-directory override), `.gemini/.env` and `.gemini/tmp/` (Gemini CLI). User-level config under `~` never enters the repo, so it needs no entry. Keel never creates any personal file — they are the user's own; the entries only make them uncommittable.

**One narrow exception, and it is deliberate: `.claude/settings.local.json`.** The session-start setup batch (SKILL.md, "Session start setup"; procedure in `references/keel-maintenance.md`) writes or merges that one file once the user has chosen automatic mode — the MODE is their decision, the file that implements it is not a second question — and tells them it did. The reason the rest of this section survives untouched is that the file is machine-local and gitignored: it binds this checkout and nobody else, so writing it publishes nothing and imposes nothing — unlike `.claude/settings.json`, which is committed and therefore still requires the user's explicit confirmation per "Permission allow-lists" above. The merge never removes or reorders a rule the user put there.

## Adoption specifics

- Rules and agents materialize AFTER adoption step 4, because their source is the as-built technical plan — and they encode the OBSERVED conventions (adoption principle: conventions are observed, not imposed), even where Keel's defaults would differ.
- The pre-commit gate and the `.gitignore` entries can be installed immediately at adoption step 2 with the user's approval — they protect from the first commit and impose nothing on the code.
- If the adopted repo already carries native config for ANY assistant (`.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `.github/instructions/`, `.github/agents/`, `.gemini/`, `.codex/`, `.windsurf/`, nested `AGENTS.md` files), treat it like existing code: inventory it, keep it, and reconcile — never overwrite. Conflicts between existing rules and the as-built plan are surfaced to the user and recorded, exactly like any other adoption gap.

## Definition of done (this reference)

- The offer was made once (0a / adoption step 2), and the project card carries the `Assistant config:` line with the accepted tools listed and a D-entry for what was accepted.
- Accepted rules/agents exist in EVERY accepted tool's container, are path-scoped (where the tool scopes), under ~40 lines each, generated from recorded decisions, and point to their `docs/` sources instead of duplicating them — identical substance across containers.
- Permission allow-lists, if accepted: built only from verified plan/playground commands and explicitly confirmed by the user before writing, one per capable accepted tool.
- The pre-commit gate, if accepted: installed (`.githooks/pre-commit` + `core.hooksPath`), VERIFIED by blocking a synthetic secret, and its collaborator setup line documented.
- MCP registration exists only if the plan defines dev MCP servers, carries no literal secret in any container, and was confirmed.
- The CI workflow, if accepted and the forge supports CI: one workflow, on push and PR, running the plan's EXACT verified commands (install → lint → build → full test suite) plus the secret scan and `scripts/keel-verify` — nothing invented.
- `.gitignore` includes the unconditional entries (`CLAUDE.local.md`, `.claude/settings.local.json`, `.keel-update-check`, `docs/continuation-prompt.md`) plus the accepted tools' personal files.
- Phase 7's export-ignore covers every generated config tree (`.claude/`, `.agents/`, `.codex/`, `.cursor/`, `.gemini/`, `.windsurf/`, `.github/instructions/`, `.github/agents/`, `.vscode/mcp.json`, `.githooks/`, `.mcp.json`, nested context files); nothing from this package ships.
- Every generated piece is reflected in the project card and `docs/decisions.md`; no piece is ever regenerated silently.
