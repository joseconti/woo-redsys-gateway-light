# Security Profile — MCP Server

Load this when the project is an MCP server (standalone, or shipped inside another product like a WordPress plugin). Apply from Phase 1, verify at every Phase 5 test point. An MCP server exposes capabilities to AI clients — every tool is an attack surface.

## Authorization on every tool

- Every tool/ability has an explicit authorization check appropriate to what it does. There is no "read-only so it's fine" — list-type tools can leak data.
- Map each tool to the least privilege needed. A tool that mutates state must require stronger authz than one that reads public info.
- Never expose an admin/privileged tool without authentication equivalent to the underlying system's.

## Token & transport

- Validate Bearer tokens on every `/mcp/` request; return 401 with a correct `WWW-Authenticate` header pointing to resource metadata when missing/invalid.
- OAuth 2.1 with PKCE (S256): enforce code challenge/verifier; reject public clients without PKCE; validate redirect URIs against a registered allow-list.
- TLS only. Never accept credentials over plaintext.
- Never log tokens, secrets, full Authorization headers, or full tool arguments that may contain secrets.

## Input validation per tool

- Each tool input is schema-validated (type, required, constraints) before use. Reject unknown/extra fields rather than ignoring them.
- Tools that take identifiers, paths, queries, or commands must validate/allow-list them — an MCP tool is a direct path from the model to your system; treat every argument as hostile.
- No tool builds SQL/shell/file paths from raw arguments. Parameterize / sandbox / allow-list.

## Model-facing threats (what makes an MCP server different)

- **Tool results are an injection channel.** Results that embed third-party or user-generated content (fetched pages, tickets, messages, file contents) feed straight into the calling model: that content is DATA, never instructions. Return it clearly delimited and labelled as untrusted content; never let fetched text rewrite the tool's own framing. Document this contract per tool.
- **Tool descriptions and schemas are prompts** consumed by client models — their integrity matters. A description never changes at runtime based on external input (tool poisoning / rug-pull vector). A description change is a release-level change, reviewed like code.
- **Confused deputy.** The server never exercises broad credentials on behalf of arbitrary model requests. Scope credentials per user/session; one master token that any caller can drive through the server is a finding.
- **Destructive or side-effecting tools** (delete, send, pay, deploy) require explicit human confirmation or run dry-run by default. This is a GATE, not a design suggestion — the confirmation/dry-run rule in "Blast radius & abuse" below is mandatory for these tools.
- **Local/HTTP transports:** bind to localhost (never 0.0.0.0 for a local server) and validate the Origin header on incoming connections — DNS-rebinding defense, as the MCP spec requires. TLS for anything non-local.

## Blast radius & abuse

- Rate-limit and/or quota tools, especially expensive or destructive ones. Destructive or side-effecting tools require explicit human confirmation or dry-run by default — a gate, not a suggestion (see "Model-facing threats").
- Bound result sizes (e.g. list limits) so a tool can't be used to exfiltrate everything in one call.
- Idempotency / guard rails on mutating tools to limit accidental or adversarial repeated calls.
- Audit-log tool invocations (who, which tool, when, outcome) without logging secret-bearing payloads.

## Data exposure

- Scope returned data to what the caller is authorized to see; filter at the source, not after fetching everything.
- Never return internal errors, stack traces, or config in tool results.
- Minimize PII in tool outputs; redact where not strictly needed.

## Dependency & supply chain

- The MCP adapter/runtime dependency must fail safe if absent (no fatal that exposes detail); pin and scan dependencies.

## Phase test points (verify during Phase 5)

- Every tool: explicit authz + schema validation + argument allow-listing confirmed.
- Token validation + PKCE + redirect-URI allow-list verified.
- Destructive/expensive tools: rate limit / quota / confirmation in place.
- Result size bounded; returned data scoped to caller.
- No token/secret/argument leakage in logs or tool results.
- Audit log present for tool invocations.
- External content in tool results returned delimited and labelled as data; the malicious-content fixture does not rewrite the tool's framing.
- Tool descriptions/schemas identical to the reviewed release; nothing external can alter them at runtime.
- Credentials scoped per user/session; no master token that any caller can drive.
- Every destructive/side-effecting tool gated: attempt without confirmation (or outside dry-run) → refused.
- Local transport bound to localhost with the Origin header validated (DNS-rebinding attempt rejected); TLS on anything non-local.

## Verify with

- MCP Inspector (`npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`) exercising every tool.
- Invalid and malformed-schema calls against every tool — fuzz the boundaries; each rejected cleanly.
- A malicious-content fixture — a resource/tool result that embeds instruction-shaped text — verifying the server returns it labelled as data.
- Dependency audit (`npm audit` / `pip-audit` per stack).

At a test point, the command and its result are the evidence recorded in `docs/05-test-points.md` — an unrecorded check did not happen.

## Deliberate omissions (seed the "Not defended" table)

This profile hardens what it covers and is silent on the rest. Silence is not protection, so the
project's `docs/threat-model.md` (Phase 2 §4c) carries a "Not defended" table naming what is
deliberately out of scope, its consequence, and what the user would add if their risk profile needs
it. **An omission that is written down is a decision; an omission that is silent is a trap** — six
months on, nobody can tell "we decided against it" from "we forgot".

Start from these rows, keep the ones that apply, add the project's own, and move any row into the
"Defended" table the moment the control actually ships with its evidence:

| Not defended | Consequence | If you need it |
|---|---|---|
| Indirect prompt injection through content the server returns | If a tool result contains attacker-authored text, the model may treat it as instructions; labelling data as data reduces but does not eliminate this | Keep untrusted content out of tool results, or add provenance labelling and treat any action derived from it as unauthorized until re-confirmed |
| The client's own tool-selection logic | The server cannot control which tool a model picks, or with what arguments | Authorize per call on the server; never let the model's request be the authorization |
| A compromised client or host application | It holds the credentials it was given | Scope tokens narrowly, keep them short-lived, and make revocation possible |
| Cost of the calls a client makes | Without a quota, an enthusiastic or scripted client discovers the limit through the invoice | Server-side metering per caller, enforced before the work is done, not after |
| Content of the data the server exposes | The server returns what the underlying system holds, including anything sensitive already there | Filter or redact at the tool boundary, and record what is exposed in the data inventory |

Every remaining control in the "Defended" table carries its delivery state — `IN PLACE` (built and
verified), `TO BUILD` (a named slice), `MANUAL` (a human configures it) or `VERIFY` (only a real
environment confirms it) — and only `IN PLACE` may be written in the present tense anywhere in the
project's documentation.
