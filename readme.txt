== Description ==

= Light version Features =

This is the Light version of the official WooCommerce Redsys plugin at WooCommerce.com.

You can find the PRO version at [woocommerce.com](https://woocommerce.com/products/redsys-gateway/)

With this extension, you get all you need to use Redsys Gateway.

* Gateway language selection from settings.

* Added checkout logo customization.

As this is WooCommerce official extension, always will be compatible with the latest WooCommerce version.

Why is it not compatible with versions of WooCommerce lower than 2.9? Because they have vulnerabilities, and I will not support versions that you should not use.
